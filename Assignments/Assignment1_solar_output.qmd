The energy produced by a solar panel system is given by

$$
E = A \cdot r \cdot H \cdot PR
$$

where:

-   $E$ is the energy produced (kWh),
-   $A$ is the solar panel area (m$^2$),
-   $r$ is the panel yield (dimensionless, 0–1), representing manufacturer efficiency (typically $\sim 0.2$),
-   $PR$ is the performance ratio (dimensionless, 0–1), accounting for site-specific losses (typically $\sim 0.75$),
-   $H$ is the annual average solar radiation (kWh m$^{-2}$).

Write your function in R; make sure that you add documentation; include default values for *r* and *PR* in the function definition; save the function in a single file to upload to Canvas.

```{r}
#' Calculate Solar Panel Energy Output
#'
#' @param panel_area 
#' The solar panel area (m^2)
#' @param solar_rad 
#' The annual average solar radiation (kWh m^{-2})
#' @returns
#' The energy produced (kWh)

solar_calculation <- function(panel_area, solar_rad){
  energy_prod = (panel_area * .25 * solar_rad * .75)
  return(energy_prod)
}
```
